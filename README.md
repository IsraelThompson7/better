The Study Dictionary
====================

The Study Dictionary is a dictionary built on the [Wordnik API](http://developer.wordnik.com) which stores words in reading lists ideal for books or weekly vocabulary tests.

Compiling
---------

After downloading The Study Dictionary from github, download the submodules with the following commands.
<pre>
git submodule init
git submodule update
</pre>

Open StudyDictionary.xcodeproj in Xcode 4.

After applying for an API key at [wordnik.com](http://developer.wordnik.com) change WORDNIK_API in StudyDictionaryAPIConstants.h to the value of your Wordnik API.

Icons
--------

All of the TabBar icons are [glyphish](http://www.glyphish.com) icons which you can purchase for only $25.
The Icons, Launch, and Misc images I made myself. If I can make the images, then a master such as yourself can too.
