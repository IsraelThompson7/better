The Study Dictionary
====================

The Study Dictionary is a dictionary built on the [Wordnik API](http://developer.wordnik.com) which stores words in reading lists ideal for books or weekly vocabulary tests.

Compiling
---------

Open StudyDictionary.xcodeproj in Xcode 4.

After applying for an API key at [wordnik.com](http://developer.wordnik.com) change WORDNIK_API in StudyDictionaryAPIConstants.h to the value of your Wordnik API.

The project will not compile unless the missing images are removed from the Xcode project or replaced.
All of the TabBar icons are [glyphish](http://www.glyphish.com) icons which you can purchase for only $25.
The Icons, Launch, and Misc images I made myself. If I can make the images, then a master such as yourself can too.
